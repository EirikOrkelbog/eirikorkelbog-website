					Most fashion e-commerce brands focus on branding and aesthetics â€”
					but that&apos;s not enough to scale. If your store isn&apos;t built with
					conversion systems in place, you&apos;re losing sales every single day.

						<p className="text-gray-700">
							Your homepage looks nice but doesn&apos;t guide users. Your product pages lack
							trust elements. You have no real lead capture strategy, and your emails
							barely convert. You&apos;re not missing a creative director - you&apos;re missing
							a growth operator.

						<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What You Need</h3>
						<p className="text-gray-700">
							A CRO-focused store structure. Sections designed to convert. Lead capture
							that actually grows your list. And automated systems that turn traffic
							into sales - not just pretty pixels. Thats what I build for you in 30 days.
